    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Katelyn Carriker</strong> — tech-whisperer, problem-solver, and cat-enthusiast who’s happiest when systems are organized, documentation is clean, and people feel empowered by their tech instead of frustrated by it.</p>

    <p>With 5+ years of experience supporting enterprise platforms and leading end-user support, I’ve built my career on keeping technology seamless so people can focus on the work that matters.</p>

    <p>I started in end-user support, delivering white-glove service and triaging issues with precision, and eventually transitioned into application administration and light development—where I found my love for improving systems from the inside out.</p>

    <p>I’ve managed and supported Atlassian, Adobe, Planful, and Concur environments, collaborating closely with stakeholders and cross-functional teams to bridge the gap between users and technology. Whether it’s solving a complex issue, designing a cleaner workflow, or mentoring teammates, I care deeply about making tech feel calm, clear, and quietly efficient.</p>

    <p>I believe curiosity is the best skill anyone can have. It’s what’s carried me through every role I’ve taken — from helping someone one-on-one to building something that helps hundreds at once.</p>

    <p>Outside of work, I spend my time with my fiancé, reading fantasy books, tending to my plants, and caring for a small army of cats, a bearded dragon, a rabbit, and a puppy. My life isn’t always perfectly ordered, but it’s full — and I wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>
