    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>Hi, Iâ€™m <strong>Katelyn Carriker</strong> â€” tech-whisperer, problem-solver, and cat-enthusiast whoâ€™s happiest when systems are organized, documentation is clean, and people feel empowered by their tech instead of frustrated by it.</p>

    <p>With 5+ years of experience supporting enterprise platforms and leading end-user support, Iâ€™ve built my career on keeping technology seamless so people can focus on the work that matters.</p>

    <p>I started in end-user support, delivering white-glove service and triaging issues with precision, and eventually transitioned into application administration and light developmentâ€”where I found my love for improving systems from the inside out.</p>

    <p>Iâ€™ve managed and supported Atlassian, Adobe, Planful, and Concur environments, collaborating closely with stakeholders and cross-functional teams to bridge the gap between users and technology. Whether itâ€™s solving a complex issue, designing a cleaner workflow, or mentoring teammates, I care deeply about making tech feel calm, clear, and quietly efficient.</p>

    <p>I believe curiosity is the best skill anyone can have. Itâ€™s whatâ€™s carried me through every role Iâ€™ve taken â€” from helping someone one-on-one to building something that helps hundreds at once.</p>

    <p>Outside of work, I spend my time with my fiancÃ©, reading fantasy books, tending to my plants, and caring for a small army of cats, a bearded dragon, a rabbit, and a puppy. My life isnâ€™t always perfectly ordered, but itâ€™s full â€” and I wouldnâ€™t have it any other way.</p>
